# Frontend Mini-Projects

This course focuses on building 20 practical frontend projects entirely from scratch using **HTML5**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, without the use of any external frameworks or libraries. Each project introduces dynamic functionality, ranging from interactive games and utilities to media applications and UI components.
